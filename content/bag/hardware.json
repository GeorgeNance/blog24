			"description": "Before I got these as a gift, I thought the Airpods Pro was the best wireless earbuds. But these are on a whole different level. The sound quality is amazing, the noise cancellation is great, and the battery life is much better than the Airpods Pro. I use these for everything, from listening to music to taking calls. I highly recommend these.",
