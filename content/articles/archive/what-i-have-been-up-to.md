It has been awhile since I did one of these. I have had quite a few life things going on.

I started working out again. This has been a major mood booster to me lately. This combined with a better diet has led to start losing weight, which is always awesome. I wouldnt say working out has become a habit yet, but I do feel crummy when I skip a day.

I made a music video for a film class. This was one of best experiences of my year. I made some new friends and I rediscovered something that I am really passionate about. The video itself turned out pretty well and I can say that it has been my best work so far. My film teacher even liked it so much that he gave my entire group an A for the class. Yes not just the project itself, but the entire class. That was beyond amazing. Here is the video:

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/127148575">Lights Music Video Student Project</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user39962875">George Nance</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

This video and the group of people I worked with made me really miss making videos. I always loved filmmaking, I remember trying to make films using a old razor phone camera and stiching them together. During high school I was involved in a TV broadcast class and I got alot of experience from that. After high school, I didn't do alot with it and slowly started to give up. I switched my major to computer science because thats where the jobs are. Not alot of jobs for video making that lets you have creative freedom. But I am starting to think that maybe I should have went with film. I feel confident that I can make decent videos, I just really need to start. I need actors, I need better ideas, and I need people with passion.

I also miss working on my game. After finishing that video project, I became really depressed because I invested so much into that project and everything was suddenly over. It felt like I just released my child into the world and I had nothing else to be a part of. Yes, I did have my game, but the kind of reactions I got from the video surpass anything that I have ever received from programming. This doesnt mean I don't like programming, I love it. But I, like many people, want to feel like I'm important. Alot of the work I do on this game will never be noticed. When its released people will take it at face value and never see the long nights I spent working on it. The game with either be good or crap.

That is a real bummer.
