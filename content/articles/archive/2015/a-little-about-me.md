The year was 2004, My parents bought me my first PC. I didn't have a clue about anything. I called over a friend to help me set it all up. He was a bit annoyed that I needed his help for some menial task like installing Windows. After everything got set up, I popped in The Sims 2 and installed it. Back then, installing games could take almost an hour. For that hour I never stopped looking at the screen. I was so amazed by the image slideshow on the install screen. It was magical to my 12 year old mind. I then got a crazy idea. I wanted to make something that the computer could display like that loading screen. Err....well I didn't want to make a loading screen exactly. I wanted to make a program that the computer could see. Little did I know that 10 years later I would be creating my own game.

A few months later, I downloaded a program called GameMaker 6.0 . This was Game Maker before YoYo games picked it up. Anyways, I opened the program and I was overwhelmed by everything involved. What was a sprite? What is a scene? Why is everything is so ugly? Well I didn't come up with the answer to those questions until a couple years later, except for it being so ugly. I still have no idea.

After a couple years of trying to be less computer savvy in favor of being more social, I tried it again. I wanted to recreate a flash game called [Stick RPG](http://www.xgenstudios.com/play/stickrpg). My version included a guy who had a goal of just getting money and buying cool things. It was an RPG with poorly drawn stick figures. I actually got done with it too. It looked like crap and fortunately it was before online storage was popular so it was lost forever. But I made a freakin game!

Fast forward to 2013, I decided to try learning Python. Struggling through tutorials, I made a small app to check the price on computer parts. It wasn't impressive at all and I'm 90% sure most of the code wasn't mine The next project I made was a bot for [reddit](https://github.com/BudaDude/a_random_gif-bot). Making this bot, led me to understanding programming for the first time. I can only describe the moment as moving the square block to square hole instead of shoving it into the triangle shaped hole. Everything just clicked for me then.

Now I am working on my first real game that I hope to release soon. I have had alot of help over the years be learning aspects that I never thought I would use. What I learned in high school algebra actually has meaning now. If I would have told my 12 year old self that someday he would make a game, he would have ran around in his room while screaming like a maniac. But he would also think I was the coolest person. I would be his hero.

So I guess the answer to the question, Why gamedev? It's because some part of me loves making the computer blink lights in certain patterns like my 12 year old self wanted. Gamedev is my escape from the world. I always have the say over what happens in the game. Not so much the same for my life. My code only does what I tell it to do. It's my work of art.
