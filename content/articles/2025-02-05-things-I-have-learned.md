- If it was not in the ask, don't do it.
- Pad out your expected delivery dates. Its better to get something done early than late.
- PHP is secretly a really good programming language for web servers.
- New javascript frameworks will burn you. Stick to battle tested libraries that won't get abandoned.
- Languages don't really matter as much as you think they do.
- Learning something new is hard, but the [click]() will come.
- AI is awesome, but letting it write your whole project makes programming more tedious than it should be. It sucks the joy out of problem solving.
- Good programmers have blogs. Read them.
- Soft skills are hard but worth investing in. You will see results quickly.
- The real world is not reddit, X, or Hacker News. 
- The EU is way better at Open Source than the US. 
- Good planning is the most valuable and underrated skill in programming.
- Docker is worth learning.
