## Professional Background & Skills

I specialize in building, refining, and optimizing web applications, with expertise in:

- Frontend: JavaScript TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

- Backend: Laravel, PHP, Python, Node.js, Nest.js

- AI & ML: Stable Diffusion, LLMs of all shapes and sizes

- Tools & DevOps: Docker, Vite, VS Code, Cursor

Beyond development, I've also led a class on Internet Marketing and Design, sharing my knowledge with aspiring tech enthusiasts.

## Personal Journey

I was born and raised in Springfield, Illinois. Home of the famous Route 66, Lincoln, and the horse shoe sandwhich.

My fascination with technology started with video games like RuneScape and The Sims 2, which made me curious about how things worked behind the scenes. I wanted to learn how to make my own games, so I downloaded GameMaker 6.0 and started making my own games. That slowly evolved into a passion for programming and problem-solving.

I didn't take the traditional path into tech—I grew up in foster care and spent most of my teenage years in a group home. While in college, I lost both my parents and had to make some hard decisions about where I wanted my life to go. So I made the completely sane decision to move 1500 miles away from my family and friends to start a new life in Arizona. I was able to get a job working as an intern at a "startup-like" company that worked with b2b clients. From there, I was hooked. 

Currently, I'm working as a Full Stack Developer at One Origin. I also have ran a side business with my fiancee, Maddie, creating AI pet portraits.

## Interests & Hobbies

When I'm not coding, I'm usually:

- Exploring mindfulness through meditation and writing

- Playing video games. [Here is what I am currently playing](/now)

- Capturing moments with photography and design

- Staying active with fitness and exercise

 

## My Approach

A great project isn't just about writing code—it's about solving real problems. I believe in:

- User Experience First – Everything I build is designed with usability in mind.

- Keep It Simple – Clean, maintainable code always beats over-engineering.

- Continuous Learning – The tech world moves fast, and I stay on top of it.

- Collaboration & Creativity – The best ideas often come from working with others.

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to discussing ideas, collaborating on projects, or just geeking out over tech. Feel free to reach out through my contact page or social media.
