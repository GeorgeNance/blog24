      When querying published articles:

      1. Use the simple equality operator:
         ```typescript
         .where("published", "=", true)
         ```

      2. Keep queries consistent across components

      3. The published field is defined as z.boolean() in content.config.ts

examples:
  - input: |
      // Bad: Using numeric values
      .where("published", "=", 1)
      
      // Bad: Using MongoDB operators
      .where({ published: { $eq: true } })
      
      // Bad: Using negative conditions
      .where("published", "!=", false)

      // Good: Simple boolean equality
      .where("published", "=", true)
    output: "Correctly formatted published field query"
