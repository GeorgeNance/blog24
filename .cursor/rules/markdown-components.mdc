# Markdown Components Organization

Rules for organizing and implementing markdown components in the codebase.

<rule>
name: markdown_components_location
description: All markdown components must be placed in the components/content directory

filters:

  - type: file_extension
    pattern: "\\.vue$"
  # Match component creation events

      When creating components for markdown content:

      1. Always place markdown components in the components/content directory:
         ```
         components/content/
         ├── Quote.vue
         ├── Callout.vue
         └── ...
         ```

      2. Register components properly:
         - Use `defineComponent({ name: 'ComponentName' })` to register with Nuxt Content
         - Follow the naming convention (PascalCase for component names)

      3. Usage in markdown:
         ```md
         ::ComponentName
         Content goes here

         #slotName
         Slot content goes here
         ::
         ```

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Component in wrong location
      components/Quote.vue
      
      # Good: Component in correct location
      components/content/Quote.vue
    output: "Correctly placed markdown component"
